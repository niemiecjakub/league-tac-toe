## How to play League-Tac-Toe

- A 3 x 3 square grid is lined up with criteria like legacy, position, resource, rangetype and region.
- Place your marker, an X or O, in one of the squares if you can name League of Legends champion that matches the criteria across the top row and left hand side.
- The first to get three in a row, vertically, horizontally or diagonally, is the winner.
- With steal mode enabled, each player has 3 steals in total, where a square can be stolen that is occupied by the opposing player.
